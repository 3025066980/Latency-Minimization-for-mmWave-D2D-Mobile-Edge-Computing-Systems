Simulation code for paper  Latency-Minimization-for-mmWave-D2D-Mobile-Edge-Computing-Systems: Joint-Task-Allocation-And-
hybrif-beamforming

Simulation code for the original manuscript is in original

The Algorithm 1 is included in main.m and you can directly run it.

I have packed Algorithm 2 as a function and if you want to tune it, please comment the function head and uncomment the tuning part.

The benchmarks is avaible at https://github.com/yuxianghao/Alternating-minimization-algorithms-for-hybrid-precoding-in-millimeter-wave-MIMO-systems
